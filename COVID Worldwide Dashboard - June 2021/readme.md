# Summary
## The goal of this project was the following:
* ### Get data from Our World in Data data set
* ### Ask descriptive questions about the rows and columns, the facts and dimensions. I want to figure out what has happened over the course of the pandemic.
* ### Organization and Processing data in Excel
* ### Cleaning the data in SQL for joins, and later visualization in Tableau
* ### Analyzing and Transforming the data in SQL (BigQuery) to find results from January 2020 - May 2021.
* ### Visualizing data in Tableau with a dashboard to describe and forecast the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Approach
* ### Upload data into Excel and organized and processed data set for easier querying
* ### Pull data with queries using BigQuery, also create temp table for partitioning aggregate functions against different parameters if need be
* ### Manipulate data in BigQuery to find answers
* ### Create Tableau dashboard to visualize findings

# Results
* ### Google BigQuery tables that describe different facts about the COVID-19 pandemic
* ### [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/trenton.moore4482/viz/WorldwideCOVIDDashboard/Dashboard1) - Colorful dashboard that visualizes all my findings into one
