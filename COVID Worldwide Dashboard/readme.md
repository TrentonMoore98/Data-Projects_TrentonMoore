## Approach
* Organized datasets in Excel for easier querying and joining
* Pull data in BigQuery using queries, also created a temp table to partition and do an aggregate function on different parameters if need be
* Manipulate the data using BigQuery
* Create Tableau dashboard to desribe findings


## Results
* [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/trenton.moore4482/viz/WorldwideCOVIDDashboard/Dashboard1) - Colorful Tableau Dashboard showing my results and projections
* Google BigQuery tables that describe different facts about the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as some projections.
