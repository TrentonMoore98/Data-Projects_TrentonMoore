# Summary

## The goal of this project was the following:
* ### Summarize ROI in marketing channels
* ### Clean messy data in Excel for effective analysis
* ### Determine most effective attribution in those channels and Find trends to make business decisions
* ### Data Scaffolding for Data Modelling
* ### Visualize findings for target audience

# Approach 
* ### Find problems in the data sets, approach data quality issues by communicating with stakeholders and looking into relevant systems to clean up for accurate results.
* ### Create summary tables of all Revenue, Ad Spend and ROI between each marketing channel, as well as ROI per attribution.
* ### Take iterative approach to visualization, don't be married to a visualization. Give your audience your first prototype, and take that feedback to create your second, third, etc etc.
